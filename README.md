# Sphinx Tribes 🌐

![Tribes](https://github.com/stakwork/sphinx-tribes/raw/master/img/sphinx-tribes.png)

Welcome to **sphinx-tribes** - the decentralized message broker designed for public groups in Sphinx. Empowering users to run their own **sphinx-tribes** server, this platform seamlessly routes group messages for various applications such as **sphinx-relay** nodes, apps, websites, or IoT devices.

## How it Works 🚀

**sphinx-tribes** operates as an MQTT broker that any node can subscribe to. Message topics always consist of two parts: `{receiverPubKey}/{groupUUID}`. Only the group owner has the privilege to publish messages, and all messages from group members are required to be submitted to the owner as a Lightning keysend payment. The group `uuid` is essentially a timestamp signed by the owner.

## Authentication 🔒

The authentication process is seamlessly handled by [sphinx-auth](https://github.com/stakwork/sphinx-auth).

## Running Against Sphinx-Stack 🏃

To run the **tribes** frontend locally, utilize the following ports:

- Tribes: `yarn start:tribes:docker` (localhost:23000)
- People: `yarn start:people:docker` (localhost:23007)

## Running Frontend Against people.sphinx.chat Locally 🌐

If you wish to run only the frontend, follow these steps:

1. Modify line 10 in `src/config/ModeDispatcher.tsx`: 
 - Change `'localhost:3000': AppMode.TRIBES` to `'localhost:3000': AppMode.COMMUNITY`

2. Modify line 27 in `src/config/ModeDispatcher.tsx`: 
 - Change `return hosts[host] || AppMode.TRIBES;` to `return hosts[host] || AppMode.COMMUNITY;`

3. Modify line 6 in `src/config/host.ts`: 
 - Change `return host;` to `return 'people-test.sphinx.chat';`

4. Open the terminal. Locate your folder and then run:

- `yarn install` to install the dependencies
- `yarn start` to run the frontend locally
