# Sphinx Tribes üåê

![Tribes](https://github.com/stakwork/sphinx-tribes/raw/master/img/sphinx-tribes.png)

Welcome to **Sphinx Tribes** - a decentralized message broker designed for public groups in Sphinx Chat. Empowering users to run their own **Sphinx Tribes** server, this platform seamlessly routes group messages for various applications such as **sphinx-relay** nodes, apps, websites, or IoT devices. 

Additionally, a subset of **Sphinx Tribes** is the Bounties Platform - a global marketplace for work paid out in bitcoin bounties. 

## How it Works üöÄ

### Sphinx Tribes
**Sphinx Tribes** operates as an MQTT broker that any node can subscribe to. Message topics always consist of two parts: `{receiverPubKey}/{groupUUID}`. Only the group owner has the privilege to publish messages, and all messages from group members are required to be submitted to the owner as a Lightning keysend payment. The group `uuid` is essentially a timestamp signed by the owner.

### Bounties Platform
The **sphinx-tribes-frontend** also contains the frontend for the bounties platform website. In order to run the website locally on your computer, you'll need to run sphinx-tribes-frontend as a whole. You can find the backend repo at [sphinx-tribes](https://github.com/stakwork/sphinx-tribes).


## Authentication üîí

The authentication process is seamlessly handled by [sphinx-auth](https://github.com/stakwork/sphinx-auth).

## Running Against Sphinx-Stack üèÉ

To run the **tribes** frontend locally, utilize the following ports:

- Tribes: `yarn start:tribes:docker` (localhost:23000)
- People: `yarn start:people:docker` (localhost:23007)

## Running Frontend Against people.sphinx.chat Locally üåê

If you wish to run only the frontend, follow these steps:

1. Modify line 10 in `src/config/ModeDispatcher.tsx`: 
 - Change `'localhost:3000': AppMode.TRIBES` to `'localhost:3000': AppMode.COMMUNITY`

2. Modify line 27 in `src/config/ModeDispatcher.tsx`: 
 - Change `return hosts[host] || AppMode.TRIBES;` to `return hosts[host] || AppMode.COMMUNITY;`

3. Modify line 6 in `src/config/host.ts`: 
 - Change `return host;` to `return 'people-test.sphinx.chat';`

4. Open the terminal. Locate your folder and then run:

- `yarn install` to install the dependencies
- `yarn start` to run the frontend locally
