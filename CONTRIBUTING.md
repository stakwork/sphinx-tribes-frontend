# Frontend Contributing Guidelines 💻

Thank you for considering contributing to our project! Here are some guidelines to ensure smooth collaboration.

### File Naming Convention 📁

- All React component files should be named in Pascal case (e.g., `MyComponent`).
- React component functions should also be named in Pascal case (e.g., `function MyComponent() {}`).
- Folders should be named in camel case (e.g., `peopleData`).
- Typescript files should follow camel case.
- Only the `index.tsx` files should be named in lowercase.

### Prettier Fixing 🛠️

- Run the following command to fix Prettier errors before submitting:
  ```
  yarn run prettier
  ```

### Eslint Fixing 🚨

- Run the following command to fix ESLint issues and ensure all test cases pass:
  ```
  yarn run eslint
  ```
