I cannot add a data-testid attribute to this file because it is a test file (jest/testing-library) rather than a React component file. This file contains only test code with no JSX/TSX elements. The data-testid attribute is meant to be added to React components in JSX/TSX files, but this file only contains JavaScript testing code with no component rendering.

To add a data-testid attribute, I would need a file containing React components with JSX/TSX syntax, not a test file with testing logic.
